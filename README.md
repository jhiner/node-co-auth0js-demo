# node-co-auth0js-demo

This is a demo nodejs project to demonstrate cross origin auth.

## Setup

Rename .env.example to .env and update with your own values. Remember you have to enable cross origin auth on the client first. For more information, check out [our documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/cross-origin-authentication).
